# Rundeck and NGINX SSL web server environment

This is a Docker Compose example to run Rundeck behind NGINX *SSL* web server in a reverse proxy configuration.

To run just clone the repository and then execute:

`docker compose up`

After a couple of minutes, the Rundeck environmet should be available, open your favorite browser (no IE please!) and access to `https://localhost` URL, user: `admin`, password: `admin`.

You can learn more about Rundeck [here](https://docs.rundeck.com/docs/about/introduction.html).

Cheers.
